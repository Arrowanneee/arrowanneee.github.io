<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field across LLM, design, and the Metaverse at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of [Pan Hui](https://panhui.people.ust.hk/publications.html). Before joining HKUST, I worked at the [City Science Lab @shanghai](https://tjdi.tongji.edu.cn/about.do?ID=75&lang=_en)‚Äî a collaboration between the MIT Media Lab and Tongji University. I graduated with top honors from the School of Architecture and Applied Art at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts and earned a Distinction in the MArch program at the Bartlett School, University College London. 

With a background in design and architecture, I am particularly interested in technology-enhanced creativity and design. My art and design work has been featured in exhibitions such as Chinese CHI, the NTU Art Exhibition, the Johan Verbeke International Exhibition. I currently split my time between Hong Kong and Guangzhou ([MC2 lab](https://mc2-lab-hkust.netlify.app/)).

**Pinning ‚ÄúReflection‚Äù on the Agenda: Investigating Reflection in Human‚ÄìLLM Co-Creation for Creative Coding**

**Anqi Wang**, Zhizhuo Yin, Yulu Hu, Yuanyuan Mao, Lei Han, Xin Tong, Keqin Jiao, Pan Hui

Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW '25), Bergen, Norway, October 2025  *(Date of acceptance: 19 June 2025)*
- We demonstrate how Baumer‚Äôs reflection typology applies and adapts in the context of LLM-based creative coding; 
- We conduct an empirical evidence showing how task-decomposed prompting fosters deeper, more strategic reflection; 
- We propose design implications for rethinking reflective prompting beyond productivity scaffolding, but as a catalyst for creative reasoning and adaptive goal-setting.
